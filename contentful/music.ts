                    "Following success producing for numerous contemporaries including Talib Kweli, Beanie Sigel and most notably Jay-Z, Kanye West released his debut studio album, The College Dropout, on February 10, 2004. The album features string arrangements, choirs and his signature soul sampling, frequently branded as chipmunk-esque for its sped-up and high pitched nature. Contrary to the popular gangster-persona lyrics that were so popular in hip-hop at the time, his lyrics mostly revolved around themes of family, materialism, religion and racism. Kanye explained the title in an interview with MTV: The name of my album is called The College Dropout. All that’s saying is make your own decisions. Don’t let society tell you, ‘This is what you have to do.’ Society told me, ‘Man, don’t move from Chicago.’ People told me to stay in school, this music is this, this music is that. I listen to John Mayer, and his song ‘No Such Thing’ is exactly what my [philosophy] is about, but in different words. Kanye himself happens to be a college dropout: he initially attended the American Academy of Art in Chicago and then transferred to Chicago State University, where his mother was a professor. He dropped out of Chicago State at age 20, as he already had a production deal on the table from Columbia Records. His mother later commented on him dropping out, saying: It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life … but some career goals don’t require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout, it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you. The inspiration for finally making his own music came when he was involved in a near-fatal car crash. With his jaw wired shut, he recorded the album’s lead single, “Through the Wire,” which was released on September 30, 2003. On December 2, 2003, Kanye released the album’s second single, “Slow Jamz.”",

                    "The second studio album from Kanye West, Late Registration is noted for its continued exploration of the social themes introduced in The College Dropout as well as the orchestral production influenced by album co-producer Jon Brion. The album spawned Kanye classics such as “Touch the Sky,” “Hey Mama,” “Diamonds from Sierra Leone,” and his best-selling song to date, “Gold Digger.” Late Registration debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and has sold 3.1 million in the US. Kanye’s new found success after his breakout album The College Dropout allowed him to expand his ambitions from a single violinist he used in the The College Dropout (see “The New Workout Plan”) to an entire string orchestra in the song “Late” with ten violins, four violas, and four cellos. Lyrically, the album features a mix of more socially charged songs such as “Crack Music” and “Diamonds from Sierra Leone” to more personal cuts like “Hey Mama” and “Roses.” Production-wise, ‘Ye was inspired by British trip hop band Portishead. He was particularly influenced by their 1998 live album Roseland NYC Live, which featured the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He strove to establish a new type of sampling sound, one that relied heavily on string arrangements. He achieved this sound by working with producer and composer Jon Brion, who also produced Fiona Apple’s monumental second album, When The Pawn…. Brion describe Late Registration as 'definitely not just a hip-hop album.' Since the album’s release it has been critically acclaimed: listed as number 118 in Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, holding a score of 85 on Metacritic, and brandishing a 9.5 rating on Pitchfork.",
