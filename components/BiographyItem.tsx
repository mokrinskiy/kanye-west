                        Kanye Omari West was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on June
                        8, 1977. His father, Ray, was a photojournalist for the
                        Atlanta Journal newspaper and was also politically
                        active in the Black Panthers; he later became a
                        Christian counselor. West&apos;s mother, Donda, was a teacher
                        who became a professor of English at Chicago State
                        University, and eventually, her son&apos;s manager before she
                        died at the age of 58 from heart disease after cosmetic
                        surgery in 2007. Her passing would profoundly affect
                        West musically as well as personally.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Ray and Donda divorced amicably when West was
                        three. After that he was raised on Chicago&apos;s
                        middle-class South Shore neighborhood by his mother, and
                        spent summers with his father. At the age of 10, West
                        moved for a year with Donda to China, where she taught
                        as part of a university-exchange program; he was the
                        only foreigner in his class. After returning to Chicago,
                        West was drawn to the South Side&apos;s hip-hop scene, and he
                        befriended the DJ and producer No I.D., who became his
                        mentor. West graduated from Polaris High School and won
                        a scholarship to study at Chicago&apos;s American Academy of
                        Art â€” but dropped out of college altogether to pursue
                        music, an act that would inform the title of his first
                        solo album years later.
